# Codius host

**NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**

This is a prototype implementation of a Codius host. Codius hosts run contracts and provide them with APIs that allow for key generation, interaction with outside systems and lots more! Please keep in mind that is an early prototype and it's still missing a lot of functionality for it to be secure, stable and useful.

## Installation

``` sh
git clone git@github.com:codius/codius-host.git
cd codius-host
npm install
node app
```

## Now what?

To interact with your Codius host, checkout the [Codius CLI](https://github.com/codius/codius-cli).
